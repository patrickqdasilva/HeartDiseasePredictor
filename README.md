# HeartDiseasePredictor
* The aim of this project is to apply the basics of Pyspark, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib as well as to experiment with the machine learning pipeline * This model will assess common influences on heart disease to potentially predict early onset of the disease * Ideally this project could be used to help patients receive preventative care before the regular onset of symptoms
